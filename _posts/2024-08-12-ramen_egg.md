    1. For soft boiled eggs, bring a pot of water to a boil, then gently lower each egg into the pot. Set a timer for 6 minutes for room temperature eggs or 7 minutes for cold eggs from the refrigerator. Stir the eggs in one direction for the first 30 seconds for an even cross section.
    2. After the timer is up, place the eggs in an ice bath to stop cooking. Once cooled, crack the shell all over and carefully peel the egg.
    3. In a plastic container, add the water, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, and optional additional soy sauce (for deeper color). 
    4. Gently place the eggs inside the container, ensuring the eggs are covered in the marinade. Add more water or stock if needed. 
    5. Serve by cutting in half and place on top of ramen noodles or rice bowls. Enjoy!
